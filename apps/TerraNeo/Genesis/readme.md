### TerraNeo - Genesis

This is the first app under TerraNeo, which currently implements the TALA formulation in Mantle convection modelling.

This app could serve as the first template/base, if someone in the future wants to develop a more complicated model for mantle convection with a different formulation.

For the benefit of the user the parameter files are split in the config folder. One can use the appropriate files to specify/control the model variable they need.
