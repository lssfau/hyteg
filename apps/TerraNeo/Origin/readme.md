### TerraNeo - Origin

This is the first app under TerraNeo, which currently implements the TALA formulation in Mantle convection modelling.

This app could serve as the first template/base, if someone in the future wants to develop a more complicated model for mantle convection with a different formulation.

For the benefit of the user the parameter files are split in the config folder. One can use the appropriate files to specify/control the model variable they need.

Parameter file
- The default parameter file `default.prm` just contains paths.
- The user can either give the path to the config folder with the specific `prm` files or can choose to load the full parameter file from the `default.prm`.
- Other parameters must be set in either `config` or the parameter file the user chooses to use.

##### NOTE: Make sure to use proper file paths (maybe all absolute to be safe)
