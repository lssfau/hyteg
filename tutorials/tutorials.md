The tutorials are split into sections for the users benefit. We have covered the basics of the framework from both software and application perspective. In addition there are tutorials to write various full apps with finite element method. As the framwork is focussed for geophysical applications, we intend to provide benchmark problems from the geophysical community as tutorials which would also serve as a good starting point for geophysicists to use the framework.
