\page Tutorials Tutorials

The tutorials are split into sections for easier orientation. They cover the
basics of the framework from both the perspective of application writers
(Basic_Apps) to people who want to delve deeper into the concepts and internals
of HyTeG (Basics_HyTeG) and potentially maybe also contribute.

In addition there are tutorials that showcase various full applications
(Full_Apps) solving problems with the finite element method using HyTeG,
as well as e.g. transport of particles. Since one of the original key drivers
or developing HyTeG was the efficient solution of geophysical applications, we
have a section ((Basics_HyTeG) demonstrating how to solve different benchmark
problems from the geophysics community. These can serve as a good starting
point for geophysicists to use the framework.

Extending the number of tutorials is an action item on our todo list.
