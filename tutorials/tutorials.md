The tutorials are split into sections for easier orientation. They cover the
asics of the framework from both the perspective of application writers to
leople who want to delve deeper into the concepts and internals of HyTeG and
potentially maybe also contribute.

In addition there are tutorials that showcase various full apps solving
problems with the finite element method using HyTeG, as well as e.g. transport
of particles. Since one of the original key drivers or developing HyTeG was the
efficient solution of geophysical applications, we have a section demonstrating
how to solve different benchmark problems from the geophysics community. These
can serve as a good starting point for geophysicists to se the framework.

Extending the number of tutorials is an action item on our todo list.
